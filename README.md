## Summary
 The script provides convenience to retrieve candidate results and voter turnout by county.
 
This script could be expanded to determine the percentage of each county voted. This information could be useful for future candidates in their decision making and where to focus their campaign. This expansion would be accomplished by using an if-statement.  The script could also be modified by state instead of county. 

This script can be used for your convenience, and it can be modified to retrieve an answer for any of your questions.
